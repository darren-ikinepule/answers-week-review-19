# TypeScript Group Test

## Group 1:

Add a new value to each player. `isSouthIslander`. At the moment all players have the South Islander badge showing on their profile. it should only show for these players:

- Aaron Smith (Highlanders)
- Sam Whitelock (Crusaders)
- Richie Mo'unga (Crusaders)

We don't know this player's location so the badge should not be shown for them:
- Will Jordan (Crusaders)


## Group 2:

Add a new value to each player. `isNorthIslander`. Create a blue "North Islander" badge that shows for North Island players. The badge should only show for these players:

- Beauden Barrett (Blues)
- Brodie Retallick (Chiefs)  
- Ardie Savea (Hurricanes)
- Jordie Barrett (Hurricanes)

We don't know these players' location so the badge should not be shown for them:
- Rieko Ioane (Blues)
- Dane Coles (Hurricanes)

Style the North Islander badge with a blue background (#007bff) to distinguish it from the green South Islander badge.
